# ramboso_xterm
A simple Linux terminal.    
For now, it's just for Linux, but, I want to port it to BSDs and Windows.

## Purposes
This project is for learning purpouses. I am going to try to do everything for my own.     
I want to work with C and Syscalls.

To create the commands for my terminal, I am going use only the C library Wrapper functions.
